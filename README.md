# lab5
In this laboratory work the simulation is created. The simulation consists of matches and one match is equivalent to 30 rounds. Some features were implemented, for example headshot that penetrates armor and if armor = 0 it kills the player instantly. Another feature is Eco rounds, I set the rule to 3 rounds but it can be modified as wished. When a team is losing 3 rounds(or the nr specified) in a row, the next round doesn't buy anything from other categories then pistols, this meaning a economical round. Another feature implemented in this laboratory is the levels of damage depending of the armor that each player is having or not having.
